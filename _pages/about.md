About Me 
------

Hi! My name's Ishan and I'm currently a Senior at Thomas S. Wootton High School based in Rockville, Maryland. I'm deeply interested in studying the intersection of Sociology, Public Policy, and Economics in college and later hope to pursue a career in Immigration Law or start my own non-profit organization.
